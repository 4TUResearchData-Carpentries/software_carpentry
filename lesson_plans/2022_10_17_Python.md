## Session 2  - Programming with Python

### Program

12:15 - Organizers/instructors/helpers in the Zoom meeting room to check last set ups, introductions etc   
12:30 - Start workshop and let participants in! We should not need time to check installations as any remaining problems are addressed on day 3. 

12:30 - Welcome and instructions of the day @ Paula
- Reminder Code of Conduct/How to get help. 
- Programme of the day
- Ice breaker   

12:40 - Recap of Day 2 (5 minutes)   
12:45 - Making Choices (20 minutes teaching + 5 minutes exercise)   
- [Lesson 7](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/07-cond/index.html)

**Plenary Exercises:**
- Plenum: [How many paths?](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/07-cond/index.html#how-many-paths )

- Together, inspect all datasets for suspicious data

13:15 - Creating Functions (20 minutes teaching + 5 minutes plenum exercises)
- [Lesson 8](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html)

**Plenary Exercises:**
- Plenum: [Mixing Default and Non-Default Parameters](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html#mixing-default-and-non-default-parameters)


13:40 - Breakout Session 1 (20 min) 

14:00: Coffee Break I

14:10: Modular coding

1.	[Tidying-up](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html#tidying-up)   
2.	Create script called `processing.py`   
3.	Copy functions (visualize, detect_problems) to script   
4.	Create new notebook called `inflammation_analysis_refactored.ipynb`   
5.	Import (visualize, detect_problems) in the new notebook and place in for-loop to analyse for all files   
6.	Questions in session:   
a.	Do we still need to import numpy and matplotlib when we are importing them in the `processing.py` script?    
_No, this is handled in the script._   
b.	What happens to the savefig in the loop?    
_Currently, during each loop the file `inflammation.png` is overwritten. Solution for future sessions: We could add new savenames or leave the savefig out of the functions entirely for simplicity._
