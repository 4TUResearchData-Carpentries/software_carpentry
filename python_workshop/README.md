# Workshop notebooks

These materials are generated during hands-on coding during the two workshop days. As part of the lessons, we build an analysis script (`inflammation_analysis`) to combine loading, analyzing, and plotting steps. Subsequently, we will refactor this analysis into separate functions and create the notebook `inflammation_analysis_refactored` with the accompanying script `processing.py`.
