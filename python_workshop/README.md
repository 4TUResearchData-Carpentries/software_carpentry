# Workshop notebooks

These materials are generated during hands-on coding during the two workshop days. The hands-on coding thus starts with an empty notebook.

As part of the lessons, we iteratively build an analysis script (`inflammation_analysis.ipynb`) to combine loading, analyzing, and plotting steps. This can then be extended with a for-loop, conditional statements, and defensive programming after explaining these concepts with simple examples in the hands-on coding notebook. At the end, we will refactor this analysis into separate functions and create the notebook `inflammation_analysis_refactored` with the accompanying script `processing.py`.
