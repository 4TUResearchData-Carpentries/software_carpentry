# Intructor materials

The instructor materials consist of two lectures and two exercise notebooks. The html slides are generated from the jupyter notebooks by executing the notebook (see last cell in each notebook). 

- The lectures are used in between teaching modules to introduce concepts and repeat key lessons.
- The exercise notebook contain answers and are (currently) not designed for self-paced learning.
